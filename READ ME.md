# Andrew's Memory Game

In Udacity course i had to create a memory game where
upon clicked, two cards match and stay open. When all cards
are matched, a popup message appears and congratulates for winning
the game. The popup gives how much time it took, the score and how
many moves it took to finish.

## How to Play:

* The goal is to match all the cards together and win the game.

- Start by clicking on two cards, if they match, look for another
pair of cards. If cards are not a pair, try again. Keep matching up
pairs until all cards are matched and faced up.

- Congratulations, we have a winner! An alert window appears tell you your
score, time, and moves it took to complete the game.

- On the Alert window, you can hit 'Go Again!' to have another go
at the game, keep playing for the best score and brag off to your friends.
